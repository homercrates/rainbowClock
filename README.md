rainbow clock!  Non traditional clock styling.  60 seconds fills the seconds box.  tell the time by how full the timer box is.  as it fills it renders a new color down the RGB scope on its way down the rainbow. 

Clock is set for 24 hour show  but written to show 12.

still need to fix the minutes and hours with the coloring.

This project was just a fun way to minipulate the canvas and crawl up and down the RGB scale to create a gradation manually.
