# Rainbow Clock
## About
rainbow clock! Non traditional clock styling.  60 seconds fills the seconds box.  tell the time by how full the timer box is.  as it fills it renders a new color down the RGB scope on its way down the rainbow. 

Clock is set for 24 hour show  but written to show 12.

# WIP Things still needed to be attended too
still need to fix the minutes and hours with the coloring.

## thoughts
This project was just a fun way to minipulate the canvas and crawl up and down the RGB scale to create a gradation manually.
